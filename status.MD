# Kubernetes Management Platform - Project Status Report

## Project Overview
This project develops a comprehensive in-house cloud platform for managing on-premises Kubernetes clusters across the company. The solution consists of two main components: a CLI tool and a Web Application, both designed to streamline cluster operations, enhance security, and provide enterprise-grade management capabilities.

## 1. Completed Features âœ…

### CLI Component
- **Authentication & Authorization**
    - Login/logout with Azure SSO integration
    - Group-level command permissions and role-based access control
    - Secure configuration file management

- **Core Kubernetes Operations**
    - `apply` - Apply configurations to resources
    - `config` - Manage kubeconfig contexts
    - `create` - Create Kubernetes resources
    - `delete` - Delete resources safely
    - `describe` - Get detailed resource information
    - `edit` - Edit resources in-place
    - `exec` - Execute commands in containers
    - `expose` - Expose services and deployments
    - `get` - Retrieve resource information
    - `logs` - View container logs
    - `patch` - Update resource fields
    - `rollout` - Manage deployment rollouts
    - `set` - Configure resource properties

### Web Application Component
- **Authentication & Navigation**
    - Login/logout with Azure AD SSO integration
    - Namespace visibility and switching capabilities

- **Resource Monitoring & Visualization**
    - **Pods**: Display pod status, CPU/memory usage, and associated metadata
    - **Deployments**: Monitor deployment status and associated pod relationships
    - **StatefulSets**: Track StatefulSet health and linked pod information
    - **Nodes**: View node resources, memory utilization, and cluster capacity
    - **Services**: Display service configurations and endpoints
    - **Storage**: Monitor Persistent Volumes (PV) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVC)
    - **Events**: View Helen events for troubleshooting and system monitoring

## 2. Ongoing/In-Progress Features ðŸš§

### Web Component Development
- **Node Maintenance Operations**:
    - Enable users to place nodes into maintenance mode (node draining) for single or multiple nodes
    - Provide functionality to uncordon nodes (single or multiple) after maintenance completion
- **ServiceNow Integration**: Implement RFC-based maintenance workflow integration

### Outstanding Questions and Proposed Solutions for Ongoing Tasks

#### **RFC Assignment Flexibility Challenge**
**Current Issue**: When an RFC is assigned to user `X`, and user `X` becomes unavailable due to emergency situations or unavoidable tasks during the RFC planned maintenance window, users `Y` or `Z` cannot perform operations using that RFC. The current implementation restricts RFC operations to only the originally assigned user.

**Proposed Solution Based on Current Understanding**:
- Implement a backup assignee or secondary assignee field during RFC creation to ensure continuity of operations when the primary assignee becomes unavailable.

#### **RFC Timeline Extension Challenge**
**Current Issue**: When maintenance operations encounter unexpected issues that extend beyond the allocated time frame, and the RFC planned end date is exceeded, users cannot continue operations. Currently, users can only perform RFC-related operations from the RFC planned start date until one hour before the RFC planned end date.

**Proposed Solutions Based on Current Understanding**:
- Implement functionality to update the RFC planned end date in real-time when operations require additional time beyond the original allocation.
- Add a comments text field that captures the commit ID of an L3-level person who serves as the accountable authority, particularly when L2-level personnel are performing operations under the RFC.

## 3. Next Steps & Planned Features ðŸš€

### Web Component Enhancement Roadmap

#### **External System Integrations**
- **Orion Integration**: Integrate with Orion platform for enhanced monitoring and observability capabilities
- **Run.ai Integration**: Implement AI/ML workload management and resource optimization features

#### **Operational Management Features**
- **Server Snapshot Management**: Implement automated snapshot functionality for servers before and after patching/maintenance operations
- **Cluster and User Onboarding**: Develop streamlined mechanisms for smooth onboarding of new clusters and user management
- **Application Health Dashboards**: Create comprehensive health monitoring dashboards for all applications across the platform
- **Validation Frameworks**: Implement pre and post-validation checks for all applications during patching and maintenance operations

#### **Enhanced User Interface Capabilities**
- **Pod Log Access**: Provide users with the ability to view pod logs directly through the web interface
- **Resource Management Operations**: Enable full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations based on user roles for:
    - Deployments, StatefulSets, Services, and Ingress resources
    - Services, Persistent Volumes, and Persistent Volume Claims
    - ConfigMaps and related configuration resources
- **Rollout Management**: Implement comprehensive rollout operations accessible through the web portal interface

#### **Reporting and Analytics Capabilities**
- **Automated Reporting System**: Generate daily, weekly, and monthly reports covering cluster health, resource utilization, and operational metrics
- **Performance Analytics**: Implement resource utilization tracking and trend analysis for capacity planning

#### **Future Enhancement Considerations**
- **Multi-Cluster Management**: Centralized dashboard for managing multiple Kubernetes clusters
- **Advanced Security Features**: Enhanced role-based access control, comprehensive audit logging, and compliance reporting
- **Disaster Recovery**: Automated backup strategies and disaster recovery procedures
- **Cost Optimization**: Resource cost tracking and optimization recommendations
- **API Development**: RESTful API interfaces for third-party integrations and automation workflows

## Conclusion

The Kubernetes management platform is progressing toward becoming a comprehensive enterprise solution that will significantly enhance our infrastructure management capabilities. The completed CLI tools and foundational web components provide a robust starting point, while the planned web component enhancements will establish a complete self-service portal.

This evolution will reduce operational overhead, improve efficiency across development teams, and position the organization with enterprise-grade container orchestration management capabilities that rival commercial solutions.
